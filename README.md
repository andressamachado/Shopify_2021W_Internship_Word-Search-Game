# Word Search Game Application for Android
by **Andressa Machado**

## Description
`Word Search Game is a randomized 10 x 10 grid where the words are placed for the user to find by swiping over them.` implemented for Shopify internship application.

The application shows the words to be found by the user in the grid at the bottom of the screen, keeps track of the number of words found,
keeps track of the time passed and allows the user to start a new game when every word is found.

- [x] Animated Splash Screen

- [x] Application is adapted to landscape mode

- [x] Words are randomly placed in the grid

- [x] User can find the words by swiping over the words

## Android version 
Application was developed using `Android SDK 6.0 API 23 Marshmallow`.

## Running the Application
1. An APK was generated and added to this repository, you can find it following this path [Word-Search-Game/app/release/app-release.apk](https://github.com/andressamachado/Word-Search-Game/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk)

Download the APK and open it on your phone, it will install the application on your device.

2. You can always HTTPS clone the project using:

 `git clone https://github.com/andressamachado/Shopify_2021W_Internship_Word-Search-Game.git` 
 
 on your terminal and, using Android Studio, run the application using an Android Virtual Device (AVD) with API 23.

[ *Please, be aware that this application was developed under API 23 and some functions could not run properly in some devices with lower API.* ]

## Limitations
- An algorithm was implemented to make sure the words are placed randomly every time a new game starts, for that reason, sometimes is not possible to place every 6 words in the grid as another algorithm was implemented to make sure words are placed properly without overlaping. 

- Game is not adapted for every screen size on the market. Application was developed using a Pixel AVD and my personal smartphone Nexus 6.

- Diagonal swipe is working, although needs to be adjusted
